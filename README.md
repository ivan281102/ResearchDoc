# Intro to Algorithms


**Algorithm representation**	

_-Flowchart_: Is a diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm. They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. Flowcharts, sometimes spelled as flow charts, use rectangles, ovals, diamonds and potentially numerous other shapes to define the type of step, along with connecting arrows to define flow and sequence.

_-Pseudo code_: Is a high-level design of a program or algorithm. Sequence and selection are two constructs used in pseudo code. Pseudo code is easier than a flow chart visualizes the algorithm while pseudo code can be easily modified and updated. Errors in design can be caught very early in pseudo code. This saves the cost of fixing defects later.




**Data types and expressions**

A data type is a set of values and a set of operations on those values. The following are four primitive data types that are the basis of the Java language:
•	Integers, with arithmetic operations (int)
•	Real numbers, again with arithmetic operations (double)
•	Booleans, the set of values {true, false} with logical operations (boolean)
•	Characters, the alphanumeric characters and symbols that you type (char)
Typical expressions are infix: a literal (or an expression), followed by an operator, followed by another literal (or another expression). When an expression contains more than one operator, the order in which they are applied is often significant.





**Problem solving methods**

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Is used when products or processes fail, so corrective action can be taken to prevent further failures. It can also be applied to a product or process prior to an actual failure event—when a potential problem can be predicted and analyzed, and mitigation applied so the problem never occurs. Techniques such as failure mode and effects analysis can be used to proactively reduce the likelihood of problems occurring.
